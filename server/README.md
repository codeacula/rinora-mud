# Server Plugin

The idea behind this plugin is to handle all the network communication between the game and the user, along with
allowing the game to send the user special data and have it processed as expected. While we're currently using ASCII
via Telnet, this same premise would work for whatever networking layer we wanted to implement. Below you can find some
documentation about the workflow.
